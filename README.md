# YourMemoryPalace

This program is ready to be used, but the documentation isn't complete for this project.

This program allows you to upload photos of rooms and add text descriptions.  The user can then navigate the rooms.  

Thirty rooms were used to test this program.  A thirty room memory palace can be used to memorize a 1200 digit number forwards, backwards, and by position.  The memory palace can be used for many things, such as memorizing 900 topics using 30 rooms.  For instance, two rooms can represent 60 programming best practices.
